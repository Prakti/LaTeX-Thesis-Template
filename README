Master Thesis LaTeX Template
============================

The main document is 'masterarbeit.tex', it contains the document preamble
with all the included (and uncommented) packages you might need useful and the
overall document structure. All chapters are '\include'ed into this main
document, so SCM's like SVN, GIT, HG can handle them better.


Quickstart:
-----------
To get started:
* install all the needed packages used in 'masterarbeit.tex'
* test-compile 'masterarbeit.tex' and tune the used packages
* edit 'titlesetup.tex' and 'pdfsetup.tex' to your needs

"WARNING": You need a fairly recent version of the TikZ package in order to
           successfully compile the template. 


Acronyms:
---------
This Template comes with a database of acronyms, called 'acrodb.tex'. During
drafting and editing, use this database with all the acronyms. For the final
production of the document use 'acrobib.py' to compile a file containing only
the used acronyms, called 'acronyms.tex' and modify the '\input{}' statements at
the end of 'masterarbeit.tex'.


Images & TikZ
-------------
* All images should reside in the 'img' subdirectory.
* The file 'macros.tex' provides to commands to quickly set figures
  - One for normal figures and one for sidewaysfigures
  - Both macros prefix all labels of figures with 'fig:'
* If you use TikZ you can put global styles in the file 'img/tikzsetup.tex'
* Configuration of use TikZ libraries is also done in 'img/tikzsetup.tex'
* You should \input{} your TikZ images. I recommend the following workcycle:
  - develop your image in a separate file using 'a5paper' in 'landscape' mode
  - move reusable styles from the image to 'tikzsetup.tex'
  - \input{} your image in your text.


Fonts
-----
I have switched the used fonts from Knuths defaults (Computer Modern) to
'Times' (**not** Time New Roman), 'Helvetica' and 'ASCII'. You can find the
setttings in 'masterarbeit.tex'.
  

Macros
------
One particular strength of LaTeX is the fact, that you can define your own
macro commands which can make writing your thesis more painless. Put all your
macros in 'macros.tex'. You might want to use the 'xspace' package in several
cases. I recommend the following workcycle:

  * Detect inefficiency: complicated names or specifications, error-prone
    names, repetitive use of commands and text.
  * Refactor a fragment into a macro
  * Use the macro and improve it
  * Lather, rinse, repeat


AMS-Math
--------
The 'amsmath' packaget, together with the 'amssymb' packate comprises a
powerful math environment. Better than the standard math environments of
LaTeX. If you plan on including sophisticated formulas you should read the
'amsmath' docs.


The 'listings' package caveat
-----------------------------
Using the listings package with KOMA-Script is a little bit problematic. If
you plan on using the listings package, remember to uncomment the line
containig '\input{lsthack}' in 'masterarbeit.tex'


Versioning with GIT or HG
-------------------------
This template is versioned with GIT and Mercurial. If you cloned it, you already
should have your preferred version control. If you don't want to version
your thesis with git/hg, simply delete the '.git' or/and '.hg' subdirectories.
