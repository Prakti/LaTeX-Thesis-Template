\chapter{Review of the State of the Art}
\label{chap:relatedwork}
Here you review the state of the art relevant to your thesis. Again, a
different title is probably appropriate; e.g., "State of the Art in Zylon
Algorithms." The idea is to present (critical analysis comes a little bit
later) the major ideas in the state of the art right up to, but not including,
your own personal brilliant ideas.

You organize this section by idea, and not by author or by publication. For
example if there have been three important main approaches to Zylon Algorithms
to date, you might organize subsections around these three approaches, if
necessary:

\section{Iterative Approximation of Zylons}
\blindtext 

\section{Statistical Weighting of Zylons}
\blindtext

\section{Graph-Theoretic Approaches to Zylon Manipulation}
\blindtext

\section{A note from the Template Author}
If you are writing a master thesis, you can alternatively call this chapter
simply \textbf{'Related Work'}. It's also a good idea to try to come up with
more significant titles for your chapter than just these generic ones. If
unsure, ask your advisor how he/she likes it best.

\section{Some Filler Text to show a Sidewaysfigure}
This section shows off a custom-macro for placing figures sidweways, in case
they are to large and redesigning them is infeasible. As an example figure
\ref{fig:figure-label1} shows a large architecture diagram. 

\Blindtext

\SFIG[LOF caption for the sidewaysfigure]{The slightly longer caption,
containing additional information for the sidewaysfigure itself.}%
{figure-label1}{htbp}{%
            \input{img/mla-x-mac}
}
