\chapter{Your other Contribution}
\label{chap:contribution2}
This part of the thesis is much more free-form. It may have one or
several sections and subsections. But it all has only one purpose: to convince
the examiners that you answered the question or solved the problem that you
set for yourself in Section 4. So show what you did that is relevant to
answering the question or solving the problem: if there were blind alleys and
dead ends, do not include these, unless specifically relevant to the
demonstration that you answered the thesis question. 

\section{A Note from the Template Author}
You can span the text, describing your contribution over multiple chapters.
Again, discuss with your advisor whether this is feasible. But don't annoy
your advisor by asking him about how to structure your text. Think about what
you want to say, then create a structure, outline the content of that
structure and then present it to your advisor.
