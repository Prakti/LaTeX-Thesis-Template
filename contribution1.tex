\chapter{Your Contribution}
\label{chap:contribution1}
This part of the thesis is much more free-form. It may have one or
several sections and subsections. But it all has only one purpose: to convince
the examiners that you answered the question or solved the problem that you
set for yourself in Section 4. So show what you did that is relevant to
answering the question or solving the problem: if there were blind alleys and
dead ends, do not include these, unless specifically relevant to the
demonstration that you answered the thesis question.
