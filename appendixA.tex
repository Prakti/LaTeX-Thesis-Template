\chapter{What goes in the appendices}
\label{app:a}
Any material which impedes the smooth development
of your presentation, but which is important to justify the results of a
thesis. Generally it is material that is of too nitty-gritty a level of detail
for inclusion in the main body of the thesis, but which should be available
for perusal by the examiners to convince them sufficiently. Examples include
program listings, immense tables of data, lengthy mathematical proofs or
derivations, etc.
